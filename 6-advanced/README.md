# 🧠 Accessing the logged-in user's token cache from background apps, APIs and services

These advanced ASP.NET Core samples show how background apps, APIs and services can access  the [MSAL's access token cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/dotnet/how-to/token-cache-serialization?tabs=aspnetcore) and continue to act on-behalf of users in their absence.

The [MSAL.NET](http://aka.ms/msal-net) and the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://aka.ms/microsoft-identity-web) libraries provide various mechanisms for apps that authenticate users with the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/identityplatform) to cache [Access Tokens](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) for various resources like [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to a [distributed token cache implementations like Sql Server or Redis](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/token-cache-serialization).

This tutorial explains how by sharing the same app registration in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) (sharing the same client Id), background processes and services can still continue to work on behalf of the user after the user has exited the frontend web app.

Today, most background processes that need to work with user's data without them being present to authenticate or re-authenticate make use of [Application Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/auth/auth-concepts#microsoft-graph-permissions) which often require an [admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/v2-admin-consent). This requires an elevation of privilege and is often an unnecessary hassle as the developer originally did not intend to obtain a permission over what a user consents to their app.

## ☑️ Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An **Microsoft Entra** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get a Microsoft Entra tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Microsoft Entra** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**.  If you're signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal Microsoft account and have not created a user account in your directory before, you will need to create one before proceeding.

    ```
3. Choose one of the following tutorials to follow;
   - Navigate to the [Sharing the MSAL token cache between a web app and a background console worker app](./background-console-worker-app-webapp/README.md) tutorial where we'll learn about how to share the token cache between a Web App that signs-in users and a background console worker process.
   - Navigate to the [Share the MSAL token cache between a web app, its web API and a background console worker app](./background-console-worker-app-webapi/README.md) tutorial where we'll learn about how to share the token cache between a Web App that signs-in users, its backed Web API and a background console worker process.
